The idea is to explain what types of information is extracted, relevance & confidence scores, what's the motivation behind, who can take an advantage from it and why.

On top of presenting the latest news by category, NOW offers a broad and in-depth perspective on each story. The coloured lines in the text show concepts, tags and relationships forming the article's unique semantic fingerprint.

In this way, while reading an article, the reader can access information about people, places, organisations, quotations and the relationships between them. (what else do we extract? + something about relevance and confidence)

Readers can also see at a glance what the article is about, what other people, places and organisations are mentioned in it as well as articles with a similar semantic fingerprint.

As a result, NOW introduces a profound reading experience, which can be used for different kinds of analysis, forecasting, etc.
