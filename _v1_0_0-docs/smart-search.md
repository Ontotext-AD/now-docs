NOW's search capabilities go far beyond ordinary full text search. Right from the start, the most popular concepts in the news are presented in concept facets ordered by category and available for faceted search. There, readers can choose a concept they are interested in and observe people, organisations and places associated with it.

Or they can use the autosuggest function to search for concepts, keywords, or a combination of both, if the concept is not listed or the keyword it is not in the database.

In this way, readers can enjoy results that are interconnected and semantically enriched.
