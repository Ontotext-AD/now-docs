NOW's Top Trends feature illustrates how the most popular concepts in a category appear in the news over a specific period of time. The readers can examine patterns of behaviour for the same day, the last 7 days, or the last 30 days.

For example, on August 15th, 2015, there were 248 mentions of the United States of America in the International news category, while in the Science and Technology category it was mentioned only 20 times.

Other concepts featured most frequently in the International news category between August 8th and August 15th together with the US were Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump. However, they show different patterns of appearance depending on the events that were covered in the news during these 7 days such as Donald Trump's appearance at the Iowa State Fair, Hillary Clinton's email scandal, etc.

By observing the patterns of presence or absence of a certain concept over time, readers can analyse and monitor content such as political campaigns, new brands/products, fashion trends, etc.
