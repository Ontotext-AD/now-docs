Together with each individual news, NOW recommends more articles on the same subject as well as other articles related to its content.

For example, while reading the article "Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and the Trumpcopter descend on the Iowa State Fair", NOW also recommends "The Donald Overshadows a Clinton at Iowa State Fair", "Clinton defends, Trump attacks Saturday at the high-profile Iowa State Fair", "The Latest: Webb decries money in politics at Iowa soapbox", etc.

In this way, readers can explore the same event from different angles as covered by different news agencies and expand their knowledge by reading other stories about the same participants, places and organisations.
