## Foreword

In an effort to be transparent with our roadmap, we publish in advance the important changes we are working on. We will try to stick to our release deadlines, but usually it is much easier to commit to month or quarter estimates for some of the more difficult ones. Since we are a small team and not all dependencies are in our control, release dates can change and we will give our best to communicate updates as soon as possible. This roadmap intends to show future changes that may affect existing applications and also includes new features we are working on.
