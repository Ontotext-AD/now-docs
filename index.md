[News on the Web (NOW)](http://now.ontotext.com) is a showcase of the [Dynamic Semantic Publishing (DSP) Platform](http://ontotext.com/semantic-solutions/dynamic-semantic-publishing-platform/).

It both relies on metadata and produces rich metadata to еnable dynamic creation of custom content streams, content reuse and re-purposing, and user tailored recommendations.

All metadata is represented in RDF and is stored in our [GraphDB™ database](http://ontotext.com/products/ontotext-graphdb/). In this showcase, we have combined [DBpedia](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/) 2015, [WikiData](http://wikidata.org), and [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org) to create a high-coverage general purpose dataset, containing over 4 million People, Locations, Organizations, Animals, Plants and other Things.

NOW is the place where you can:

* discover new and interesting news, aggregated from various sources in categories;
* enjoy their semantically enriched content and get the advantage of the knowledge behind;
*	focus on the trends to see the top mentioned concepts for a particular period of time;
*	browse to see articles with similar semantic fingerprints;
*	and much more.

Find out what is possible [NOW](http://now.ontotext.com) and share your thoughts. We’ve built it not only as a showcase for dynamic semantic publishing but also as a place where we will experiment with new features and approaches, and engage you as equal partners on the level of ideas and insights.
